Rest Api Manual  :
    - all get commands should follow this form : server_address:port/api/[command]

    - ["/chargelocations_all"] : get all chargelocations regitsered in the database (if the database is completely full it may timeout while getting all the data)

    Get commands for Getting Charge locations data from our  rest api local db  :
             - "/chargelocations_nearest"  :
                    *** function ***
                    returns the nearest station  to your location

                    *** required params ***
                    "lat" , "lng" both of type double , the latitude and the longitude of the user position

               - "/chargelocations_bounds"
                    *** function ***
                    returns a list of the charge locations within determined bounds non clustered -- depends on the bounds may timeout if too many locations
                    this is here just for testing purposes
                    need to add limit to number of locations per response  or increase response time .

                    *** required params ***
                    "sw_lat" latitude of the south-west bounds point , "sw_lng" longitude of the south_west bounds point
                    "ne_lat" latitude of the south-west bounds point , "ne_lng" longitude of the south_west bounds point

               - "/chargelocations_bounds_count"
                    *** function ***
                    returns the number of stations within specified bounds

                    *** required params ***
                    same as "/chargelocations_bounds"
